    <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 text-text-primary-light dark:text-text-primary">Building This Site</h2>
    <p class="font-mono text-text-secondary-light dark:text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">I'm currently cleaning up the rough edges, testing links, etc. I want to add more visual elements and not just let it be walls of texts all around. That'll definitely be a WIP.</p>

    <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 text-text-primary-light dark:text-text-primary">Learning</h2>
    <p class="font-mono text-text-secondary-light dark:text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">Everyday I'm getting more and more into cars. When I bought my first car in 2022, I knew absolutely nothing about them. The extent of my knowledge is that I enjoyed driving them in GTA so that must translate into real life (it did), they can go fast, and that it can take me places. As I've encountered problems and realised some mechanics will charge me and arm and a leg, I've instead gone to my trusted university that is Youtube and figured it out myself. Now I haven't done anything crazy, but I'm enjoying the slow process of learning as I encounter little problems with my car.
    </br>
    <span class="font-bold">Learned how to:</span> change my oil and filter, change a tire and put on a spare, replace brake pads, restore headlights
    </br>
    <span class="font-bold">Also learning (outside of car stuff):</span> Korean, French (ongoing), brushing up on rudimentary mathematics, re-learning data structures & algorithms
  </p>

    <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 text-text-primary-light dark:text-text-primary">Making Music</h2>
    <p class="font-mono text-text-secondary-light dark:text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">Experimenting with the native sounds and plugins that Ableton has to offer. Exploring new music and preparing to make new mixes. Every year, I usually have a favourite genre or at least a genre I'm diving into deeper. It's crickets as of right now.</p>

    <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 text-text-primary-light dark:text-text-primary">Moving My Body</h2>
    <p class="font-mono text-text-secondary-light dark:text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">I've had fun finding new ways to move my body. What is working for me right now: weightlifting at home, running & sprinting, biking, dancing. Very recent development - starting Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. This martial art checks all three boxes for my great trifecta when it comes to anything physical: it's so much fun, I get to learn a new skill, and I get in great shape all at the same time!</p>

    <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 text-text-primary-light dark:text-text-primary">Reading/Watching/Playing</h2>
    <p class="font-mono text-text-secondary-light dark:text-text-secondary leading-relaxed"><span class="font-bold">Reading:</span> Beloved by Tori Morrison, Nana by Ai Yazawa<br><span class="font-bold">Watching:</span> Pluribus, Initial D, King the Land, Fast and Furious Series<br><span class="font-bold">Playing:</span> Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Overwatch, Stardew Valley</p>

    <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-8 text-text-primary-light dark:text-text-primary">The Contradiction</h2>
    <p class="font-mono text-text-secondary-light dark:text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">I feel much more aligned than usual, so none as of right now.</p>
