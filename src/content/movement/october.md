types: ["weightlifting", "running", "walking", "sprinting", "biking", "brazilian jiu jitsu", "stretching"]
notes: "My body is loving to move through different ranges of motion."
whatWorked: "Exercising with a purpose, not just rotely doing something for the sake of doing it. If there is no goal in mind, I find it boring and monotonous, which in turn makes me a lot less likely to do it. This mainly consists of weightlifting at home, but can be made much better with music. I find biking is always a nice time, yet there is always a resistance getting outside and starting."
whatDidnt: "Running didn't work out much from mid to end of October because of the weather. I do my sprints in the grass and don't want to risk further injury with slips (I got bad knees!)."
improvements: "I feel much better in my body this month which is no small feat."

### Best Workouts
Definitely rolling at the end of BJJ. As someone who was very active in their youth, finding something that feels right physically is always a joy. Even though it is sort of an individual sport, I am learning through my sensei and every other practitioner who knows even just the slighest bit more than me. Everyone is learning because there are so many combinations that can be done in the sport. It is never ending. That's really exciting to me!

I also find I give it my all, and I've realised I like to feel like I'm fighting for my life occasionally. I breathe Mars energy, so it's the perfect fit.


### Consistency Wins
Having a partner who is willing to be active with me (quite willingly) is a huge win. It helps because we can both keep each other accountable and have someone just to keep me company. It also helps that it's with my best friend!

## Challenges
Not having my sleep fixed proved to be a problem because I can't workout in the mornings/afternoons like I'm wanting to before work. I have the most physical energy during this time of day and find myself wanting to relax after work and do less physical hobbies. Will this month _finally_ be the month where I fix my sleep (again)?

### Physical Challenges
I keep having intense knee pains after BJJ, but it goes away after a few days. My sensei urges me not to do anything that causes even the slightest pain, so I stick to that.

### Mental/Motivation Challenges
This month I want to focus on working through the mental and physical barrier of being tired. I want to stick to my goal of at least acheiving 15/30 days of exercising. This starts with reaching about 3-5x/week and it will compound naturally.

## What I Learned

I'm actually a fan of martial arts! I tried Judo when I was younger and didn't really take a liking to it, but it is incredibly freeing to me right now. I find it is exactly what I need. Some part of me loves making things unique, and because of this, I'm looking at some custom gi's that would make anyone who wore it feel badass af.

## Goals for Next Month
- Take more walks: Could be slow morning walks, scent walks around dinner where everyone is cooking and it smells heavenly, or digestion walks after eating
- Increase percentage of days exercised to at least 50%
- Exercise even when I don't feel like it

_See you next month! :-)_
