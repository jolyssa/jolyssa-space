# January 2025 Movement

First month really tracking this stuff. Goal was just to move more and be intentional about it.

## Stats
- **Workout days:** 8/31 (25.8%)
- **Active days:** 15/31 (48.4%)

## Types of Movement
- Running: 3x
- Climbing: 4x
- Yoga: 1x (need more)
- Skateboarding: 7 sessions (kickflip attempts)

## Reflections

The skateboarding for kickflip practice has been humbling. Day 47 and I'm still not landing it consistently. My ankles are sore but I'm getting the motion better.

Climbing is becoming my favorite. There's something about problem-solving with your body that scratches both the physical and mental itch.

Need to be better about not skipping when stressed. That's when I need it most.
