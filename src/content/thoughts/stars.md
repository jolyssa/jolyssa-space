I haven’t really seen the stars before. At least, not like this. 

I live in the North now, and I was expecting to see stars all the time except it’s cloudy most days. That doesn’t really matter, honestly. When the stars do come out, I’m in awe every time. 

There’s a certain disconnect with the universe around me when I live in the city. You look up and you see grey skies and tall skyscrapers, but you will never get a glimpse of many celestial bodies besides the sun and the moon (both equally beautiful in their own ways). 

But there’s something about seeing the plethora of stars in the nighttime sky that captivates me. In the autumn breeze – when the seasons are starting to shift from one to another, when the cold bites a little harsher than before – I am left stunned by its beauty. 

I can’t help but lay down and stare for what seems like hours.
