# Building This Site

I've spent too long hiding. Being scared to let myself go and connect with others. This site is me being uncomfortable on purpose.

## Why Astro + Bun

I wanted to learn both technologies, so I built something real with them. That's how I learn best—by doing, not by following tutorials in isolation.

Astro makes sense for this because it's mostly static content. No need for React rendering blog posts. Bun is just stupid fast and makes JavaScript feel less painful.

## The Structure

Everything is markdown files. No database. No CMS. Just me writing in my editor and pushing to Git.

I can add a new "collection" (like Music or Making) in about 30 seconds. I can write a new post in any text editor. If Astro dies tomorrow, I still have all my content in plain markdown files.

That portability matters to me.

## The Vulnerability

This site shows everything. Finished work, works-in-progress, failed projects, half-formed thoughts. 

I'm not curating a highlight reel. I'm documenting what it looks like to try things, to be human, to feel alive.

The office hours thing terrifies me. What if nobody books? What if someone does and I'm awkward? Good. That's the point. Growth happens in discomfort.

## What's Next

I'm committing to posting at least once a week. Could be a finished music mix, could be 3 sentences about feeling stuck. Doesn't matter. The practice of showing up is what matters.

If you're reading this and you've ever felt like you can't be contained, like you want to live all the lives at once, like choosing one path means abandoning infinite others—[talk to me](/now). We're figuring this out together.
