# Building This Site

I've been wanting to build a site that encompasses all of me for a while. To document certain things, I've used <a href="http://notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> in the past and more recently shifted over to documenting everything on <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a> since I liked the idea of having all my thoughts and projects offline that I could access from anywhere. 

Using Obsidian has actually been a blast and I've had a lot of fun with the community plugins, but now the setup will be something that combines my offline, self-contained brain dump with a site that is living, breathing, and shareable to my community instead. 

I want people to know me more intimately, and here will lie all I'm willing to share to those who are curious enough to listen.

## Why Astro + Bun

I wanted to learn both technologies, so I built something real with them. That's how I learn best â€” by doing, not by following tutorials in isolation.

Astro makes sense for this because it's mostly static content. No need for React rendering blog posts. I needed to try Bun because 20-30x faster than Node is insane, and not having to use a package manager with it sealed the deal for me. Safe to say, it was a smooth transition. 

If you're a React + Node girlie, I highly recommend trying Astro and Bun!

## The Structure

Everything is markdown files. No database. No CMS (kinda). Just me writing in my editor and pushing to Git.

That portability matters to me. It has to have little to no friction in order for me to use it. I'll definitely tweak it in the future so it truly is effortless, but the way I have it set up will do for now.

## The Vulnerability

This site shows everything. Finished work, works-in-progress, failed projects, half-formed thoughts. 

I'm not curating a highlight reel. I'm documenting what it looks like to try things, to be human, to feel alive.

The office hours thing is pretty anxiety-inducing for me, but I want real connection! I find I'm not a great speaker, and I'm pretty awful at keeping a conversation going, but how will I practice without actually trying? That's all this is. 

## What's Next

I'm committing to posting at least once a week. Could be a finished music mix, could be three sentences about feeling stuck. Doesn't matter. The practice of showing up is what matters.

If you're reading this and you've ever felt like you can't be contained, like you want to live all the lives at once, like choosing one path means abandoning infinite others, [talk to me](https://cal.com/jolyssa-armstrong-qmqhat/30min). We're figuring this out together.

I'm proud to say, this is post one. Here's to many more!
