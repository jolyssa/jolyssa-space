# Template for Thoughts Posts

This is a template for thoughts/essay posts. Copy this file and edit it to create new thought pieces.

## Opening Hook

Start with something compelling - a question, observation, or story that draws the reader in.

## Main Content

Develop your thought here. This could be:

- A personal reflection on an experience
- Analysis of an idea or concept  
- A philosophical exploration
- Observations about life, technology, culture, etc.
- Stream-of-consciousness writing

Break up longer pieces with subheadings to make them more readable.

### Subheading Example

Use subheadings to organize complex thoughts.

## Closing Reflection

Wrap up your thought. This could be:

- A conclusion you've reached
- Questions for the reader to ponder
- A call to action
- Simply letting the thought hang in the air

## Notes for Publishing

- Update the date
- Write a compelling excerpt (shows on preview cards)
- Reading time will auto-calculate, but you can set it manually
- Choose tags that reflect the topic/theme
- Set mood to match the tone (optional)
- Set isTemplate to false when publishing
- Consider if this should be featured on the home page
