There is a hunger.<br>
For something unknown,<br>
What we seek is never enough<br>
Our thirst of the know is never satisfied<br>
We are starved children<br>
Stuck in the search for the insatiable.<br>

What I cosmically saw<br>
Showed me a subjective truth<br>
of all that is.<br>
We hunger.<br>

To go back<br>
We forget we are the stars<br>
The all that is<br>
And will be around us<br>
In us<br>
Between us<br>
Is us<br>

Caught up in my ego<br>
Sometimes I forget.<br>
Random pangs of remembering,<br>
I awake<br>
But it cannot be forever<br>

Not far from now I’ll fade away<br>
But a piece of me lives here in the meantime.<br>
From what I know,<br>
And that’s not much<br>
One thing is for sure,<br>
I’ll be back.<br>
