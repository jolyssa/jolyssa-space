# Rescued Street Bench Project

## The Find

Was doing my Amazon Flex route when I spotted this bench on the curb. Solid wood construction, just needed love. Couldn't leave it behind.

## The Process

### 1. Inspection
Checked for bed bugs, structural damage, loose joints. Everything was solid except the finish was trashed.

### 2. Sanding
Spent 3 hours with 80-grit to remove the old finish and stains. Switched to 120-grit for smoothing. This was the worst partâ€”so much dust.

### 3. Staining
Used Minwax Dark Walnut. Two coats, 4 hours between. The grain came out beautiful.

### 4. Sealing
Two coats of polyurethane for protection. Let it cure for 3 days before using.

## What I Learned

- Always check joints before committing to a project
- 80-grit removes old finish way faster than I thought
- Patience with drying time = better finish
- Sanding in the garage in winter = cold hands

## Cost Breakdown

- Sandpaper: $15
- Stain: $12
- Polyurethane: $18
- **Total: $45** (vs $200+ for new)

Worth it for the story alone.
