# Hereditary

Watched this again last night. Still fucked up. Still brilliant.

## Why It Works

Most horror relies on jump scares. This one just... exists in a state of dread. You feel something is wrong from frame one, and it never lets up.

The grief is real. The family dysfunction is real. Then the supernatural horror layered on top makes it unbearable in the best way.

## That Scene

You know the one. The car scene. If you've seen it, you know. If you haven't—just watch it. I can't describe it without ruining it.

The fact that the movie continues AFTER that scene, dealing with the aftermath, is what makes it transcend typical horror.

## Toni Collette

Should have won every award. That dinner scene, the grief support group, the sleepwalking revelation—she's terrifying and heartbreaking simultaneously.

## Rating: ★★★★★

Perfect horror film. Not fun horror. Existential dread horror. The kind that stays with you.
