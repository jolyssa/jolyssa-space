# Summer House Mix Vol. 3

Finally finished this one. Started with that sample from Mall Grab's "Feel U" and built around it. Wanted to capture that feeling of driving with windows down, sun setting, no destination.

## Tracklist

1. Ross from Friends - Talk to Me You'll Understand
2. Mall Grab - Feel U
3. DJ Seinfeld - U Already Know
[...]

## Production Notes

Mixed in Ableton Live 11. Used the DDJ Rev 1 for transitions, recorded in one take after practicing the flow for about a week.

The transition at 34:00 took forever to get rightâ€”kept clashing. Finally realized I needed to EQ out more mids from the incoming track.
